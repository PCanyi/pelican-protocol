forwarding needs to shut down when the client goes away

 client talks to socks-proxy which is listening, which when
 a connection is accepted, starts the forwarding machinery.
 This machinery needs to shut down when the client connection
 closes.

known hosts needs to be updated when the client accepts a new server.

server needs to record the clients key and record and issue a new login.

server needs to check for the legit login from the stored database when the client tries to connect not using the 'newacct' account.

server needs to allow 'newacct' account to login for the first time and receive a new account name.

the 2nd browser request also needs to return content.

the proxyserver/keymgr/sshclient part, aka pelican_client:
  needs to tear down connections once the browser closes them, so they aren't leaked.
