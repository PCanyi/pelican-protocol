# pelican-protocol
Pelicans are ferocious eaters of fish. According to wikipedia, in ancient Egypt the pelican "was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the underworld."[1] Pelicans are gregarious and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for a single season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are independent away from the nest.[2]

The pelican-protocol provides a means of devouring all phishing attempts. This is a prototype project. It provides means of doing user creation and authentication over an SSH based protocol that tunnels http/https. It aims for strong usability by lay persons, and provides for portable and easy key management. A proxy for the client side does the key management and server identity checking, acting in the role of ssh-agent and the ssh client. On the server side, a reverse proxy and a secure login shell to implement the server side of the protocol are provided.
