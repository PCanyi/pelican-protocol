# pelican-protocol
Pelicans are ferocious eaters of fish. According to wikipedia, in ancient Egypt the pelican "was believed to possess the ability to prophesy safe passage in the underworld."[1] Pelicans are gregarious and nest colonially. Pairs are monogamous for a single season, but the pair bond extends only to the nesting area; mates are independent away from the nest.[2]

The pelican-protocol provides a means of devouring all phish-ing attempts.
